            <h2>Understanding the ADHD Communication Gap: It's Not About Knowing the Rules—It's About Being Unable to Execute Them in the Moment</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">People with ADHD are often told they're rude, inattentive, lazy, or don't care—when the truth is the brain knows exactly what to do but struggles to do it during real-time conversation. This isn't a character flaw. It's a neurocognitive performance deficit. Let's explore what's really happening.</p>

                <p>I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and when I discovered this, so many things made sense. I've struggled to maintain quality relationships, or be a good friend. Outside looking in can look like I don't care about my relationships, but I really do. For a long time, I thought I was just broken, and I sometimes got frustrated that I don't have a "normal" brain. But my message is that none of us are broken. And I don't think any of us have a "normal" brain. Everyone has challenges, but that doesn't make us broken. Because of these challenges, we can come together and have compassion for eachother. This changes everything.</p>
